Python datatypes

Atomic
bool(i)
int (i)
float(i)

aggregate noncontainer
str(i)

sequential container
list (m)
tuple (i)

associate container
dict (m)
neither seq nor associate
set (m)

(i) = immutable
(m) = mutable

------------------
Python process RHS(right hand side) and creates an object. It infers type of object.
Hence, python is inferred type language.
Type belongs to object only. Not variable name.

Python stores  4 information inside object:
1. Object's value
2. Type
3. Memory address
4. Reference count: How many references are associated with same object.

Data Class

Python internally maintains a symbol table
del(var_name) : removes variable from scope and decrease reference count by 1

if we reassign a variable then old ref count decrease by one and new increase by 1.
There is no typecasting in python. As variable names do not have type
Python integrates with c just like JNI(java native interface).
